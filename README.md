### About

This is a very basic, light-colored syntax theme for Espresso. It currently supports HTML, XML, CSS, and LESS syntax.

(The colors may actually be *too* light. I may need to increase the contrast... I'll have to see how my eyes feel after extended use.)

### Installation

To install the theme, just drop the .css file into this folder (if the folder doesn't exist, you'll need to create it):
`~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Themes/`

(You could also just checkout the repo in that folder.)

Once the .css file is in there, just restart Espresso and you should be able to select the theme.

### Dependencies

For enabling LESS syntax in Espresso, I installed this Sugar: [LESS.sugar](https://github.com/cellfusion/LESS.sugar)

So the syntax selectors in this theme are probably specific to that.

### To-Do

* Add styles for Javascript syntax
* Add styles for Django syntax
* Create a Dark version
